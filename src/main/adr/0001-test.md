# 4. Markdown format

Date: 2016-02-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The decision records must be stored in a plain text format:

* This works well with version control systems.

* It allows the tool to modify the status of records and insert
  hyperlinks when one decision supercedes another.

* Decisions can be read in the terminal, IDE, version control
  browser, etc.

People will want to use some formatting: lists, code examples,
and so on.

People will want to view the decision records in a more readable
format than plain text, and maybe print them out.

## Decision

Record architecture decisions in [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Consequences

Decisions can be read in the terminal.

Decisions will be formatted nicely and hyperlinked by the
browsers of project hosting sites like GitHub and Bitbucket.

Tools like [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) can be used to convert
the decision records into HTML or PDF.





# Documenting UI Rendering Tests with Selenium

## Date: 2023-12-13

## Status: [Accepted/]

## Context

In order to ensure the proper rendering of the UI components in our Spring Boot application, i am using Selenium for automated UI testing.

## Decision

### Selenium Test: UI Rendering Check
1. **Test Purpose:** Verify that the UI components are rendered correctly in the Spring Boot application.

2. **Steps to Reproduce:**
  - Launch the application.
  - Navigate to the specific UI page or component.
  - Inspect and validate the rendering of UI elements.

3. **Expected Results:** The UI elements should be rendered without errors, and the layout should match the design specifications.

4. **Dependencies:**
  - The Spring Boot application must be running.
  - implementation 'org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:4.16.1' 
  - implementation 'io.github.bonigarcia:webdrivermanager:5.6.2'




5. **Technical Details:**
  - Use Selenium version 4.16.1 for UI testing.
  - Manage WebDriver dependencies with the WebdriverManager library version 5.6.2.

**Notes:**
- It's essential to keep the WebDriver versions in sync with the Selenium library.
- Regularly update dependencies to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.

## Consequences
-- The UI rendering tests will be executed automatically as part of the build
-- the chrome window will be opened and closed automatically
-- testing will take longer
